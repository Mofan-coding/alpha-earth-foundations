# AlphaEarth Foundations

A PyTorch implementation of the AlphaEarth geospatial foundation model from Google DeepMind, which generates Earth embeddings for global environmental monitoring and analysis.
Accompanying the paper is a global dataset of embeddings from 2017 to 2024, available through Earth Engine. The goal of these embeddings is to serve as a highly general geospatial representation for a huge amount of downstream applications, without the need for retraining. 

> [!NOTE]
> I trained this model on 1/40th of the Landsat subset of the OlmoEarth pretrain dataset instead of the AlphaEarth Foundations dataset. Due to resource limitations, I only used a batch size of 16 and a max number of steps of 20000, instead of the 256 batch size and 100000 steps in the paper.

### Key parts of the methodology

- **Continuous Time Support**: First EO featurization approach to support continuous time, allowing for temporal interpolation and extrapolation.
- **Space Time Precision (STP) Architecture**: Multi-resolution encoder with spatial (1/16L), temporal (1/8L), and precision (1/2L) operators - designed to maintain localized representations while also modeling long-distance relationships across time and space. 
- **von Mises-Fisher Embeddings**: 64-byte embeddings distributed on unit sphere S^63, very compact representation. 


## Architecture

### Space Time Precision (STP) Encoder

The STP encoder processes multi-temporal, multi-source data through three simultaneous operators:
- **Space Operator**: ViT-like spatial self-attention (1/16L resolution)
- **Time Operator**: Time-axial self-attention (1/8L resolution) 
- **Precision Operator**: 3x3 convolutions (1/2L resolution)

### Teacher-Student-Text Framework

1. **Teacher Video Embedding Model**: Main model with implicit decoders
2. **Student Video Embedding Model**: Shares parameters with teacher for contrastive learning
3. **Text Alignment Model**: Enables text-image contrastive learning

## Personal Re-implementation (Step-by-step)

I added a clean, educational re-implementation under `my_alphaearth_impl/` with:
- readable architecture code,
- step-by-step training script,
- and practical instructions in Chinese.
- and an English guide for international readers.

Run it with:

```bash
python my_alphaearth_impl/train_demo.py --epochs 3 --batch_size 8 --time_steps 6 --image_size 64
```
